# In these topics I will talk what I understood and did each day of Sprint - 0

## Day 1 - VSCode

### In this day we installed the tool called VSCode, which is a tool for programming, that is, text formatting like python, java, c++ and others. We also learned to download extensions that will help us, they are: Material Icon Theme, Markdown All in One, Intellicode. After that we informed everything to the Daily-Checkin.

## Day 2 - Git and GitHub

### Here we learned to download Git and use GitHub (together with Git), We created our first repository, and linked our first folder which had our name (Example: Enalab-Hiro). Besides creating our GitHub account, before creating the repository and informing again to the Daily-Checkin. Git is basically where we do our commits to "upload" our projects to our repository. GitHub is a "database" where programmers put their projects in the cloud so others can use them, or just to leave it saved without anyone knowing.

### Day 3 - MarkDown (README.md File)

### On this day, we learned how the README files work together with what markdown files are. We created our own README and put our personal information there thus understanding how MarkDown files and READMEs work. README is the information file about the project or about yourself, and MarkDown is the type of file apparently easier to use.

## Day 4 - AI and Prompt Engineering

### During the day, I studied about Prompt, I did not watch the video completely until the moment, but I will finish it soon. Until then I understood how we should create a prompt in a more effective way in AI (whatever it is), through techniques, like using tips for better and satisfactory results, creating a line of thinking with clear and direct objectives, using information to create a previous context for the AI to understand and make an answer accordingly among others.

## Day 5 - Scrum and Kanban

### On this day I studied Scrum and Kanban, Scrum is the project planning that is separated in Sprints, which have from 2 to 4 weeks of duration where we have to every day make a "report" saying what we did yesterday, today, what we intend to do and if there was any impediment. Besides having established goals that we can take in a kind of table to solve, like BackLog, Doing, Validation and Completed. Kanban just like Scrum is also a planning system based on the following steps: To do, Doing, Done. They are steps to organize the tasks to be done in the project, thus increasing efficiency and even quality, where "To do" is what should be done, "Doing" being done and "Done" which has already been done.
